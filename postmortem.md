What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

My focus for this project is to attempt things I have not tried like making elements draggable, local storage, css animation and setTimeout / setInterval. The process was quite painful as I tried to figure out everthing on my own and spend alot of time on it. This affected the HTML and CSS aspect of the project as I didn't have enough time. 

I should have set a time limit on how much time I should spend on a particular portion and ask for help if I was really ensure on what to do. 

What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?

I mananged to fufil what I set out to do despite much difficulties. As a beignner with just a few months of experience, I feel motivated to keep challenging myself to try new and difficult things. 

Code and Code Design

    What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

Through this project, I feel that my Javascript fundamentals can be strengthened. My code often break because my understanding of certain aspects of Javascript is not nuanced enough and I use the wrong methods for what I intended to do. I am aim to try to improve my fundamentals with whatever time I can spare. 

As I am still not comfortable with higher order functions, I chose to write code in a way that I feel comfortable. This led to alot of repetitions. By the next project, I hope to incoporate more use of higher order functions. 

    What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

I did wireframe and pesudo coding before I start my project. I would jot down what I want to do and break it down to different functions. This provide a framework for me to start on and it makes me feel less intimidated by the project. 

Unit 1 Post Mortem

    What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
- Ability to try my best to solve problems independently
- trying to write DRY and single responsibility code 
    
    What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
- I can do better in commenting my code 
- I still struggle with technical terms. I would understand how the logic of the code works but struggle to express it.  
    How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
- The pace of the class is managable. I like that the IA team structure the course in way that feels manageable and try not to overload us with too many things in a single lesson.
